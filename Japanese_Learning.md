## ⚙️ Systems Over Goals

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems." — James Clear

### The Difference

| Goals (Outcome-Based) | Systems (Process-Based) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| "I want to pass N5" | "I review 20 Anki cards every morning" |
| "I want to speak fluently" | "I do 1 HelloTalk voice chat every weekend" |
| "I want to learn 3000 words" | "I add 5 new words to Anki daily" |

### My Daily Systems

#### 🌅 Morning System (20-30 min)
```
1. Wake up
2. Open Anki → Review due cards (10-15 min)
3. Learn 5 new vocabulary words
4. Done. Start your day.
```

#### 🌙 Evening System (30-45 min)
```
1. Finish work/tech learning
2. Grammar study: 1 new pattern (15 min)
3. Read/Listen practice (15 min)
4. Write 1-2 sentences using today's grammar
5. Done. Prepare for sleep.
```

#### 🗓️ Weekly Systems
| Day | Extra Activity | Time |
|-----|----------------|------|
| Saturday | Speaking practice (HelloTalk) | 30 min |
| Sunday | Review week + mock quiz | 45 min |

### System Rules
1. **Never skip twice** — miss one day, NEVER miss two
2. **2-minute rule** — if unmotivated, do just 2 minutes of Anki
3. **Stack habits** — after [existing habit], I will [Japanese activity]
4. **Track streaks** — visible progress motivates continuation
